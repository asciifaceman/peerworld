# Peerworld
A naive experiment with GRPC to have a sort of non-playable game utilizing separate "living" entity instances that intercommunicate to better themselves and advance before dying.

Peerworld is a place without dimension or physical space - all entities live in a void where they are all aware of one another via the GameLeader - who acts as an exchange and record keeper.

Peers are born, and have a life span. Throughout their life they will grow, accumulate wealth, and interact with one another in their pursuit of various goals. They will spawn children who will inherit traits.
